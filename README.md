## Project Overview
A Django Rest Framework API with a Python webscraper. All data comes from and belongs to [The Bolete Filter](https://boletes.wpamushroomclub.org/) and is not intended to be used beyond personal development purposes. 
Currently paired with a basic Vue.js frontend that consumes the API. 

**What is a Bolete?**
Webster definition:   a mushroom or toadstool with pores rather than gills on the underside of the cap. Boletes often have a thick stem, and several kinds are edible.
