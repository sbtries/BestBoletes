Yellow stem has red to red brown streaks in the bottom portion, and bruises blue, aging to brown. Netting seems to bruise more red below and greenish black above.

Boletes of Eastern North America follows this by merging the American discolor into luridiformis (using Neoboletus as the genus) and then continuing to use the European name until a replacement is settled. The bottom line is this: it is a beautiful mushroom with massive flexibility in how it appears.Heres the problem: are we justified in doing the same for the North American mushrooms known by (some) of those species names? We can be pretty sure they are not the European queletii and unpublished amateur DNA work shows that the oak-loving ones do indeed follow the same pattern  massive morphological flexibility with the same DNA  but what is the appropriate American name? Especially when different reactions to both Ammonia and KOH have been reported? They probably are the same thing but we cannot say that with enough confidence to justify removing entries that still appear in the books, or to merge them without a proper, peer reviewed article in a reputable scientific journal. For this reason discolor, luridiformis and subluridellus still appear here under separate names even though they are likely to end up being merged into two species, and maybe even one mega-species. FWIW, those same DNA tests show that the hemlock loving B. subvelutipes really is a separate species. Stay tuned for new developments.",

That came under question beginning in the 2010s as DNA evidence proved that these mushrooms are quite distinct from the Rubroboletus and Suillellus genera that contain the true Satans Boletes. For what its worth, the lookalike European mushroom called luridimormis/discolor is a highly prized edible commonly known as the Scarletina.

These include B. edulis var. grandedulis (California Kings), B. rubriceps (Rocky Mountain Reds) and B. barrowsii (White Kings). So what about Europe?

More Notes: This is the only mushroom in North America that can have non-bluing yellow pores and also be a sick-maker. If you think youre looking at a possiblehuronensis, you should definitely check outthis article by mycologist Bill Bataikis in addition to your books. It contains descriptions of the mushroom from various sources, along with a number of useful photos. One particular point that may be useful is this account credited to Grund and Harrison, Nova Scotian Boletes (1976) at pp. 112-114: 2018 DNA Update: A very well confirmed find (Mushroom Observer #331948) was submitted for multigene DNA testing in late 2018, and the results answer a lot of questions. They show that huronensis is not even close to being a true Boletus, but actually does have a single close relative: the toxic Japanese bolete Neoboletus venenatus. Someone needs to write a paper",

Boletes of Eastern North America follows this by merging the American discolor into luridiformis (using Neoboletus as the genus) and then continuing to use the European name until a replacement is settled. The bottom line is this: it is a beautiful mushroom with massive flexibility in how it appears. Here's the problem  are we justified in doing the same for the North American mushrooms known by (some) of those species names? We can be pretty sure they are not the European queletii and unpublished amateur DNA work shows that the oak-loving ones do indeed follow the same pattern  massive morphological flexibility with the same DNA  but what is the appropriate American name? Especially when different reactions to both Ammonia and KOH have been reported? They probably are the same thing but we cannot say that with enough confidence to justify removing entries that still appear in the books, or to merge them without a proper, peer reviewed article in a reputable scientific journal. For this reason discolor, luridiformis and subluridellus still appear here under separate names even though they are likely to end up being merged into two species, and maybe even one mega-species. FWIW, those same DNA tests show that the hemlock loving B. subvelutipes really is a separate species. Stay tuned for new developments.",

Indeed the all-but-lookalike European mushroom now known as Suillellus queletii (f/k/a Boletus luridiformis and discolor too) has been greedily sought forever as the choice Scarletina. Your mileage may vary. For site purposes it is being promoted to iffy as a reflection of the ongoing debate, but with the proviso that all the old lore would disagree.",
            "science_notes": " The species was originally described in 1889 by the legendary mycologist Charles Horton Peck. The velvety hairs at the base  which many modern foragers have despaired of finding  was actually the basis for Pecks decision to declare it a species. Sub- = barely; velut- =velvety; and -pes = foot. After 1889 the description slowly morphed until it really came to mean, That common red-pored, blue-staining, non-reticulated mushroom in the East. In other words, genuine experts used such a broad brush that everyone knew the DNA revolution would show it to be a group of similar looking mushrooms that would need to be sorted out. And sure enough, the DNA testing has confirmed just. This site chooses to limit the name subvelutipes to the hemlock-lover because (a) that is a distinct genetic species, (b) your author participated in an effort to find an epitype to replace Pecks original holotype because that sample no longer has usable DNA, (c) the general location where we found it was dominated by hemlock, and (d) the specific finds were under a grove of hemlock. The velvety foot is very important for a firm ID, subject to environmental factors that will often hide or destroy such a delicate feature.",

They are equally good edibles so in some sense it is an academic distinction, but if you care about such things it seems to be fair to bet on the environment. L. variicolor seems to prefer wet, acidic environments while L. snellii favors loamy forest. There is crossover, however, so that is not a foolproof tool. The reported chemical test results also differ, but authorities have questioned whether the tests are unreliable for both species.\n",

Boletes of Eastern North America follows this by merging the American discolor into luridiformis (using Neoboletus as the genus) and then continuing to use the European name until a replacement is settled. The bottom line is this: it is a beautiful mushroom with massive flexibility in how it appears.Here's the problem are we justified in doing the same for the North American mushrooms known by (some) of those species names? We can be pretty sure they are not the European queletii and unpublished amateur DNA work shows that the oak-loving ones do indeed follow the same pattern  massive morphological flexibility with the same DNA  but what is the appropriate American name? Especially when different reactions to both Ammonia and KOH have been reported? They probably are the same thing but we cannot say that with enough confidence to justify removing entries that still appear in the books, or to merge them without a proper, peer reviewed article in a reputable scientific journal. For this reason discolor, luridiformis and subluridellus still appear here under separate names even though they are likely to end up being merged into two species, and maybe even one mega-species. FWIW, those same DNA tests show that the hemlock loving B. subvelutipes really is a separate species. Stay tuned for new developments.",

DNA tests have merged this back into the parent, along with moving the whole thing over to the newly erected genus Xerocomus. The var. perplexus cap was supposed to be a little lighter, with more consistent staining in the pores.",
